N Pursuers, M Evaders

DESCRIPTION:
    This game is based on the paper "Multiple Pursuers Multiple Evader
    Differential Games" by Eloy Garcia, David W. Casbeer, Alexander Von Moll and
    Meir Pachter.

    The game consists of N pursuers and M evaders, where N = M. The goal of the
    pursuers is to capture the evaders (come within some capture radius distance
    of the evaders) in the shortest time possible. The evaders aim to avoid
    capture for as long as possible.

    Pursuers are always faster than evaders. All agents have holonomic motion in
    an infinite 2D plane. The players are controlled by their optimal control
    signals from Section IV-A of the paper. At run-time, the players are all
    assigned random initial conditions (start locations and headings), as well
    as a random velocity within some allowable range. Pursuer velocities are
    within [30, 40] and evader velocities are within [10, 29].
