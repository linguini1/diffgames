2 Pursuers, 2 Evaders

DESCRIPTION:
    This game is based on the paper "Multiple Pursuers Multiple Evader
    Differential Games" by Eloy Garcia, David W. Casbeer, Alexander Von Moll and
    Meir Pachter.

    The game consists of two pursuers and two evaders. The goal of the pursuers
    is to capture the evaders (come within some capture radius distance of the
    evaders) in the shortest time possible. The evaders aim to avoid capture for
    as long as possible.

    The two pursuers are always faster than both of the evaders. All agents have
    holonomic motion in an infinite 2D plane. The players are controlled by
    their optimal control signals from Section III of the paper. At run-time,
    the players are all assigned random initial conditions (start locations and
    headings).

    The game ends when an evader is captured.
